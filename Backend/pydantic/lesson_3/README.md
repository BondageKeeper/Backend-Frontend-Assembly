# Lesson 3: Advanced Architecture & Nested Data Processing

In this final Pydantic section, I mastered professional data structuring and deep validation patterns used in production-grade AI platforms.

### Key Skills Acquired:
* **Nested Models (Вложенность)**: Architected a complex 3-layer data model (`Meta`, `Task`, `Billing`) packaged into one unified schema.
* **Smart Function Armor (`@validate_call`)**: Secured backend processing routines by automatically validating input arguments on the fly.
* **Frozen Invariance (`frozen=True`)**: Implemented immutable state controls to completely prevent financial and token cost tampering in memory.
* **Dynamic Property Math (`@computed_field`)**: Engineered self-calculating runtime properties for precise GPU billing metrics.
* **Deep Dictionary Exclusions**: Learned how to mask deep nested keys (like secret tokens or internal api versions) dynamically via granular `exclude` dictionaries.
